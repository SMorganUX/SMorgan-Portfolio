        <h1>The Magazine Project</h1>
        <h2>The Parameters</h2>
        <p>Utilizing a limited range of fonts and colors, create a 7-page magazine spread that embodies the theme of the chosen art movement as its topic. For my project, I chose to go with something a bit more challenging and used <span class="highlight">Digital Grunge</span>. This topic created more challenges due it's style requiring me to break the design principles we were trained on, and thus find the proper balance of how far I could go doing so before I broke too many of them for it to be a functional design.</p>
        <p>For text utilized, we were allowed to copy the text from an existing magazine, making our project a redesign of that magazine article is we wished. I utilized an article published on <span class="highlight">Art In Context</span>, <a href="https://artincontext.org/grunge-art/">Grunge Art - The Alternative Underworld of Grit and Imperfection</a></p>

        <h1>Previewer</h1>
        <p>The Google Drive PDF previeer is used in place of a PDF embed for compatibility due to mobile Chrome no longer supporting PDF embeds.</p>
