# FinTrack

**FinTrack** is a debt calculation and repayment application for calculating total debt, total required minimum payment, and pay-off plans. **FinTrack** utilizes the minimum payments, debt amounts, and interest rates to calculate payment plans for both the **Snowball Method** and the **Avalanche Method**. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide a smooth repayment tracking process for users that may not be the most technically or financially skilled.

A [2024 study](https://gflec.org/initiatives/personal-finance-index/) revealed that in the US, financial literacy has been approximately 50% for over 8 years, and dropped even lower in recent years. This number is [historically lower for adults aged 18-29 (GFLEC, pg 12)](https://gflec.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TIAA-Institute-and-GFLEC_Financial-literacy-and-retirement-fluency-in-America_P-Fin-2025.pdf), who are of the age to be entering college, currently attending, or recently graduated with their student loan debts, [representing 28.2% of student loan borrowers despite only composing 8.98% of the US population](https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-by-generation#:~:text=While%20Gen%20Zers%20over%2018%20represent%208.98%25%20of%20the%20U.S.%20population%20as%20of%202024%2C%20Gen%20Z%20represents%2028.2%25%20of%20student%20loan%20borrowers.). With the Federal Student Loan repayment recently unfrozen, [over 5 million people are in default](https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/collection-of-defaulted-student-loans-to-begin-soon-what-borrowers-need-to-know-now/#:~:text=As%20of%20now%2C%205.3%20million%20people%20have%20federal%20student%20loans%20in%20default%2C%20and%20another%204%20million%20are%20at%20risk%20of%20defaulting%20later%20this%20year.%C2%A0) with the number expected to rise significantly later this year. Many have voiced complaints that while making minimum payments alone, they had not realized how little of the principle their minimum payments truly covered.

While many debt repayment applications can be overwhelming, often requiring access to the user's financial accounts, this application only requires the user enter the necessary data in a format that is designed to ease the process and not overwhelm the user. **FinTrack** will allow  the users to visualize the repayment duration of all their debts and determine how high of a payment is necessary to pay them off in a timely manner.
