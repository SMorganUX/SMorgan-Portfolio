      <h1># Debt Calculator</h1>
      <p><span class="highlight">Debt Repayment Calculator (DRC)</span> is a calculation tool for tracking total debt of a user and the time to pay off said debt calculated against growing interest.</p>
      <h2>## Current State</h2>
      <p>Current state of <span class="highlight">DRC</span> is unfinished. The logic and algorithms all function to serve the purpose of receiving appropriate user information, and calculating and displaying the proper output, but a GUI has not yet been made nor necessary modifications to work with a GUI.</p>

      <h2>## Purpose</h2>
      <p><span class="highlight">DRC</span> has been developed for use as a simplified finance application during an era of ever growing individual debt with so many finance tools without the need to risk linking your private finance information with an application. As a college student surrounded by students that are soon to graduate with their student debt, a tool such as this felt like a necessity for many who might not understand the true weight debt such as this can carry or how to properly pay it off. While I myself don't have any college debt to be concerned with, I understand how daunting a task it is for many students and graduates, and that many were never provided necessary information about debt like these so I hope an application like this can help them not feel overwhelming to use.</p>

      <h3>### Intended Upgrades</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>PC/Web application GUI</li>
        <li>Mobile GUI</li>
        <li>If expanded to a full mobile application, extra features to provide basic money saving help.</li>
    </ul>
