# Debt Repayment Calculator

Debt Repayment Calculator (DRC) is a calculation tool for tracking total debt of a user and the time to pay off said debt calculated against growing interest.

## Current State

Current state of DRC is unfinished. The logic and algorithms all function to serve the purpose of receiving appropriate user information, and calculating and displaying the proper output, but a GUI has not yet been made nor necessary modifications to work with a GUI.

## Purpose

DRC has been developed for use as a simplified finance application during an era of ever growing individual debt with so many finance tools without the need to risk linking your private finance information with an application. As a college student surrounded by students that are soon to graduate with their student debt, a tool such as this felt like a necessity for many who might not understand the true weight debt such as this can carry or how to properly pay it off.

### Intended Upgrades

- PC/Web application GUI
- Mobile GUI
- If expanded to a full mobile application, extra features to provide basic money saving help.
